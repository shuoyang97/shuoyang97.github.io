        <p>Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches 
            computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by 
            example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless 
            cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish
             a pedestrian from a lamppost.</p>
        <p>Robot learning is a research field at the intersection of 
            machine learning and robotics. It studies techniques allowing 
            a robot to acquire novel skills or adapt to its environment 
            through learning algorithms. The embodiment of the robot, 
            situated in a physical embedding, provides at the same time 
            specific difficulties (e.g. high-dimensionality, real time 
            constraints for collecting data and learning) and opportunities 
            for guiding the learning process (e.g. sensorimotor synergies, 
            motor primitives).</p>

            <h1>London</h1>
            <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the  United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
