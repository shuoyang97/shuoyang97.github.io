        <p>Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches 
            computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by 
            example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless 
            cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish
             a pedestrian from a lamppost.</p>
        <p>Robot learning is a research field at the intersection of 
            machine learning and robotics. It studies techniques allowing 
            a robot to acquire novel skills or adapt to its environment 
            through learning algorithms. The embodiment of the robot, 
            situated in a physical embedding, provides at the same time 
            specific difficulties (e.g. high-dimensionality, real time 
            constraints for collecting data and learning) and opportunities 
            for guiding the learning process (e.g. sensorimotor synergies, 
            motor primitives).</p>

            <h1>MLE</h1>
            <p>In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is 
                a method of estimating the parameters of an assumed 
                probability distribution, given some observed data. This 
                is achieved by maximizing a likelihood function so that, 
                under the assumed statistical model, the observed data is 
                most probable. The point in the parameter space that 
                maximizes the likelihood function is called the maximum 
                likelihood estimate.[1] The logic of maximum likelihood is 
                both intuitive and flexible, and as such the method has 
                become a dominant means of statistical inference.</p>
